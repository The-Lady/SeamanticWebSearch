It makes my face feel clean without all the fake stuff that the 'lathered' face washes give you, and it is so gentle on my face! I suffered forever from hormonal breakouts (from birth control and PCOS) and this face wash calmed down all of that during ALL times of the month (if you catch my drift). Because of my lash extensions (gotta stay oil free), this cleanser is my end-all-be-all of face cleansers. I highly recommend it to everyone I meet!!!"" —LizGet it from Glossier for $9+ (available in two sizes). And for any ~waterproof makeup formulas~, start with their Milky Oil. | Soko GlamThey're already not very noticeable (for daytime wear), but now that you're stuck at home all day, it's even easier to stick 'em on and treat your acne at first sight! Promising review: ""I’ve tried so many products, including products prescribed by dermatologists, and none of them work as fast as the acne pimple master patch. My pimples are resolved quickly. —Anamaria W.Get a pack of 24 from Soko Glam for $5. Also available in Clear Fit and AC Collection (slightly larger, oval-shaped patches infused with soothing centella asiatica extract) versions. | @fleshbeauty / Via instagram.com, @fleshbeauty / Via instagram.comAgain, even if you're inside all day, you still need to wear SPF — sun rays can still penetrate your skin through windows!! This SPF has definitely stolen my heart. In my past sunscreen reviews, it's no surprise that I love chemical formulas and my skin handles them very well — but as always, do a patch test first if you're not sure! This SPF contains 10% homosalate, 5% octisalate, and 3% avobenzone — note that there's no oxybenzone or octinoxate, which has been in the news re: ocean preservation and the Hawaii ban. It's also super hydrating (hence the ""serum"" part), thanks to ingredients like glycerin, which attracts water to your skin. Don't fret about the white-ish color 'cause it instantly applies clear on skin. My skin doesn't feel tacky afterwards, but it definitely grips onto makeup super well. Get it from Flesh Beauty for $32. | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF Sephora, Sarah Han / BuzzFeedI actually prefer this over the cult-fave Color Correcting Treatment (see below), mostly texture-wise since it's lighter. I find that this gel cream also blurs any redness I have without feeling heavy, sticky, or taking a long time to absorb. I get redness around my nose and sometimes scattered on my cheeks, so this is a quick fix — and since it's a lot lighter than the treatment and hydrating enough for my skin type, I've been applying it day *and* night.Promising review: ""I haven't really found something that calms redness but also doesn't make me break out from being too heavy, and then I got a sample of this with an order and was pretty happy with it. My skin was super soft, stayed clear, and looked slightly less red. Then, I went on vacation to New Hampshire. I spent four and a half hours hiking in 20 degree windy weather with snow and ice blowing in my face. My skin was bright red and stung from windburn. I put some of this on after I showered, and then a little more before I went to bed. After the first time I put it on my face, it no longer stung, and by morning, my skin wasn't red at all. Normally I would be red for a few days and then peeling afterwards. I am definitely going to purchase a full size of this, and I think it will be really helpful for the New England winter and beyond."" —cayjayGet it from Sephora for $48. | Sarah Han / BuzzFeed / Via buzzfeed.comHow does it work its magic? Papaya and pineapple enzymes help loosen dead skin cells in preparation for removal, and then soft plant-based fibers act like ~micro-lint rollers~ to capture and roll away dirt and dry, flaky skin.Promising review: ""Let me tell you! I've tried EVERYTHING, including Proactive and Rodan & Fields, and nothing has helped my skin in the way that this (and the cleansing collection) have! My skin is combination that reacts to EVERYTHING, but after two days of using this, my redness, peeling, and oily patches were GONE! I can't get over how much I love this! I actually enjoy taking care of my skin now because I can see almost immediately and feel how much of a difference this has made!"" —AnonymousGet it from Target for $10.99 or Bliss for $12.99.Read my full review of the Bliss Jelly Glow Peel (#7) for more info! | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF Sarah HanIt doesn't contain your average ingredients either, but rather proven nourishing and brightening ingredients like saccharomyces ferment filtrate, bamboo water, algae extract, licorice root extract, centella asiatica leaf water — and absolutely no alcohol, parabens, or artificial fragrance.Promising review: ""This essence is brilliant. The mist is so fine and it's so quick to use in the morning when I'm in a rush. Leaves my face feeling fresh and hydrated, and I feel like my skin has been producing way less oil than it usually does."" —Alice B.Get it from Soko Glam for $24.P.S. This product was created as a result of the Acwell pH balancing toner's popularity/effectiveness, which is obviously great as well if you'd like to pair the two! | GlossierPromising review: ""I am 47 and have some age spots/discoloration, as well as splotchiness and some monthly hormonal acne. This stuff is fantastic! From the first use I noticed a difference in my skin. My pores were tighter, my face was smoother, and makeup went on better. You do have to wear an SPF because of the exfoliation, but I wear one every day anyway. After a month of use, my skin is brighter, the discoloration has lightened, and even my hormonal acne decreased. If anyone has used the expensive and hard to find Recherche Biologique 1970 toner, Glossier solution works a lot like that, without the hefty price tag. I recommend this to anyone looking to achieve brighter, clearer, and healthier skin!"" —KStern119Get it from Glossier for $24.Check out our full writeup (and reviews!) on Glossier Solution for more deets! | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF",,"March 27, 2020, 18:00 GMT",

So far we’ve watched the Back to the Future trilogy, The Goonies, Groundhog Day, and Ghostbusters. Seeing the kids enjoy these movies as much as we did as kids has been a blast.The best part of these movie nights, though — from a self-isolating perspective — is that it A) gives the kids something to look forward to all day, B) creates a bit of scheduled normalcy, and C) is family time when we can cuddle and focus on each other.",,"March 25, 2020, 16:15 GMT",

Anyway, I didn't have to wait long to test out Wine Away's effectiveness as the first red wine spill happened a couple of weeks later on my wife's brand new, super expensive runner which we weren't supposed to be drinking anywhere near and, of course, is brilliant white. At this point, I had already given up all hope of covering up my tracks but figured I might as well try Wine Away as my last-ditch 'maybe I won't have to sleep on the couch' effort. To my amazement, upon spraying Wine Away on the stain, it immediately cleared up and left no residue or dullness behind. Honestly, I even called my wife in, told her what happened, and had her search for where the stain was and she couldn't find it. Simply amazing stuff. I am now a believer in Wine Away and have used it on not only wine spills but also pet stains on various fabrics and it's always stepped up to the challenge."" —DerekGet it from Amazon for $6.67. | Amazon, amazon.comPromising review: ""These little guys work perfectly for dermaplaning!

I purchased the pink one and it contrasts nicely with my dark espresso wooden desk. The mouse moves easy and steady on the surface and has made it much easier to write on my desk. Since the desk is wooden, it's collected small imperfections over the years, making writing on the desk sometimes difficult. I would definitely recommend for new or old desks.

I have naturally frizzy hair that is also wavy and curly. I have a lot of breakage around the crown and this stuff sleeks it back but it doesn’t make it look greasy or crunchy! I suggest taking the mascara wand and wiping off the excess on the tube before applying so you don’t apply too much. When I apply too much all you have to do is let it dry and then scratch your fingernails from front to back to break it up and it still creates a sleek look without any crunchiness.

Pick your scent. Then, select your plan based on whether you want a one-time purchase or regular refill plan. Myro deodorants are cruelty-free but there's so much more to it than that. They're also aluminum-, paraben-, phthalate- and talc-free. Plus, they don't use baking soda, artificial colors, or synthetic fragrances which are known to be skin irritants. Tbh, I wasn't looking for environmentally friendly deodorant although I swear I love Mother Earth. My go-to fragrance-free deodorant was discontinued so I just desperately needed one that wouldn't irritate my sensitive underarm skin and would keep me smelling fresh. All the other natural deodorants I tried DEFINITELY DID NOT KEEP ME FRESH 🙅🏿‍♀️. I had to re-up several times throughout the day just to avoid a sweaty smell which wasn't my norm and made me feel self-conscious. Finally, I stumbled upon the Myro deodorant and figured I'd just try it since I tried everything else (Native, Tom's, Almay, you name it). I was skeptical because it smelled so good and my severely sensitive skin typically doesn't play nice with scents. I guess since the product is truly natural, that's why it didn't irritate me. Fair warning: I peeped that the deodorant has low ratings on like two sites but it appears that the Myro brand listened to the people, as its website notes that it's upgraded the formula. I've been using it for about three weeks. I apply it once daily and don't have to break my schedule to re-up, haven't had any itchy patches develop under my arms, and FINALLY get to enjoy a great scented product again, which I haven't been able to do in years. BTW, the scent I have is the Chill Wave which smells like cucumber, jasmine, and spearmint 👃🏾❤️.Get the actual deodorant from Myro for $10 (available in seven scents) and the case for FREE (refill for $10 (available in seven colors).

They fit the same, if not better. They do NOT PILL if you wash cold and hang dry. I truly feel like I’m wearing 'butter leggings' or 'like I’m naked' or whatever other claims LLR makes. The price is obviously better and more fair in my opinion. I really can’t say enough. Stop stop stop buying LLR and buy these."" —Jen WolfeGet them from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in two size ranges: S–L and XL–3X and 23 colors).",,"March 17, 2020, 12:16 GMT",

One reviewer suggested picking up a second glass bowl from a dollar store to use for rinsing after you clean — seems like a smart idea to me. Promising review: ""When I use liquid foundation and get the brushes REALLY dirty, I have to scrub them down before I wash them, but the machine gets them cleaner than I could after. The most important thing is that it DRIES them ASAP. I don't mind washing my brushes (but still, who wants to?), but I don't want damp or even wet brushes that I can't use — this solves that problem! The speed variability makes it so all my brushes are perfect! Never blown out. All of my brushes worked in this, even the ones that I thought would not — the ones that have diamond-shaped or flat-shaped handles or ones where the brush head is oddly shaped or asymmetrical. Keeping your brushes clean means having cleaner skin and more sanitary cosmetics."" —LGet it from Amazon for $49.99. | AmazonPromising review: ""These work amazingly well.

Cosmetics for $6 (available in 26 shades). | | amazon.comPromising review: ""I rarely ever leave reviews, but THIS is amazing!! I have naturally frizzy hair that is also wavy and curly. I have a lot of breakage around the crown and this stuff sleeks it back but it doesn’t make it look greasy or crunchy! I suggest taking the mascara wand and wiping off the excess on the tube before applying so you don’t apply too much. When I apply too much all you have to do is let it dry and then scratch you’re fingernails from front to back to break it up and it still creates a sleek look without any crunchiness. I love this stuff so much I need to get another for my car on those days that my mom hair is looking terrible."" —AdrianaGet it from Amazon for $7.99. | Amazon, amazon.comAvarelle's pimple patches are formulated with tea tree oil and calendula, which is said to heal and shrink zits overnight. A single pack comes with 40 patches in a variety of sizes to fit any pimple you've got.Promising review: ""I’ve tried so many brands of pimple spots, and these are hands-down the best on the market. I’m a performer at Walt Disney World, and a clear complexion is required. Last night, I put these on a few acne problems (a small cyst, a whitehead, and a pimple I shouldn’t have picked and has been a bump for about three weeks now.) I just woke up and am writing this review in disbelief. THEY'RE FLAT! Gone! All of them! I could cry I’m so happy. The packaging is also ideal, because it allows you to conveniently and easily peel the stickers off without stretching them out or folding them back on themselves. Do yourself and your complexion a huge favor! Have these on hand for a stubborn zit when you really need help. Make sure you apply them to completely clean and dry skin."" —CaitlynGet it from Amazon for $8.50. | GlossierMy coworker AnaMaria Glavan is passionate about this product. Here's what she had to say:""Believe the hype: this magic bottle is proof that not all heroes wear capes. The creamy formula, which comes in blond, black, clear, and brown (which is what I used!), goes on smoothly and doesn’t require a lot of product to do the job. I used the wand to brush baby hairs in the beginning/middle of my brow upwards, and then brushed the longer, toddler-like hairs at the end of my eyebrows, sideways. And one coat was more than enough! Boy Brow does what exactly what the Glossier brand claims to do; it gives me a filled-in eyebrow that doesn’t look filled in. The finish looks natural, which is exactly what I wanted — my facial caterpillars have never looked better.""Get it from Glossier for $16 (available in four shades). | amazon.com, AmazonPromising review: ""I absolutely LOVE this mascara. I have very sensitive eyes and am highly devoted to my trusted brands. When a friend suggested this mascara I was curious, as she loved it. For the price point and how good it looked on her eyes, I thought why not. Holy moly. I'm in love. It makes my lashes longer, — looks like I'm natural but better — and has a thinner formula so it looks like I have a billion gorgeous lashes, and looks the same all day long. I cannot recommend this enough. It doesn't rub during the day and give me that black eye look. It's wonderful. Must buy."" —Katherine OchsmanGet it from Amazon for $12.95. | Amazon, amazon.comPromising review: ""My hair is very thin and curly. The ends are damaged from heat and color, causing my hair to look even more unruly. I do oil treatments once a week and only wash my hair two to three times a week but NOTHING has made my hair feel like this product does. There is an immediate difference as soon as this product touches my hair. It leaves my hair feeling so silky, even after I rinse it out and dry my hair."" —Maegan W.Get it from Amazon for $12.95. | TartePromising review: ""Best concealer till time!!

Having 'ice pick' scars left over from acne I was told that I'd have to pay for expensive laser therapy because the body can't produce enough collagen to heal deep scars.

They are almost completely gone!"" —ShaunRead our full review of the Dermal Korea collagen sheet masks!Get them from Amazon for $9.99. | Amazon, amazon.comPromising review: ""I was lucky enough to have clear skin in high school so I never understood how awful acne really is. When I was about 21-22 years old, I switched to a birth control implant, and that thing wreaked havoc on my entire life. I suddenly had horrible cystic acne. Not only did it make me self conscious and uncomfortable, but it was actually so painful — laying on my pillow hurt my face! To top it all off, my skin was also dry, and irritated. I tried every skincare line on the market for about two to three years, with no, or very little, results. Finally, I found La Roche-Posay's skincare products. Within four days, the inflammation decreased, the redness was fading, and my skin felt less dry. By two weeks, my skin was practically clear! I have been using this product for about four to five years now, and I haven't had a single outbreak, EXCEPT for the time I wanted to try a different product to save money. Huge mistake, one I will not make again."" —LadyHawkeGet it from Amazon for $14.99. | Thrive CausemeticsFor every product purchased Thrive Causemetics donates to help a woman *thrive*.Promising review: ""This is honestly the best product. I use it on my eyes and lips and cheeks and it literally doesn't budge as eyeshadow. By the end of a 14-hour day it's still bright and beautiful. I mean it LASTS. I haven't found an eyeshadow that isn't gone by the end of the day or smudge. And it gives a beautiful glow to cheeks. WORTH IT!!"" —Marcella C.Get it from Thrive Causemetics for $36 (available in four shades). | Kylie CosmeticsEven as a 27 year old, I own more than my fair share of Kylie Cosmetics. I'm talkin' lip kits and palettes for DAYS. Why you ask? Because Kylie Jenner makes a damn good product. Her packaging is among my favorite across all beauty brands and I love that she continues to reinvent the bottles, brushes, and boxes!Promising review: ""This is my favorite gloss! I buy several high-end brands and this high gloss takes the cake! It even has the scent of cake! I’ve put it on and it keeps my lips hydrated all day! It’s not sticky like other brands tend to be. This was my first Kylie Cosmetics purchase and I’m extremely satisfied. I’m over 40 and thought, 'Is this even going to look good on me?' The answer is YES."" —DebbieGet it from Kylie Cosmetics for $16. | Olive and JuneI've been doing my own nails for a long, long time. It always seemed smarter to me to spend money on a bottle of polish I can keep instead of a manicure that only lasts a week. It's a skill that took a while to work on but, luckily, for at-home manicurists like myself The Poppy has made doing my nails a lot less challenging. It pops right onto any bottle of nail polish (not just Olive and June colors) and provides you with a stronger grip and a more accurate swipe.Get it from Olive and June or Target for $16. | Amazon, amazon.comI have one of these babies and it really is wonderful. Not only does it make me feel like I'm really getting in there while I'm washing my hair, but it also recreates that feeling you get when your hairdresser massages your head while washing it. Ugh, so good.Promising review: ""Love this product! About five days before I received it I dyed my hair at home. As some of you may know who do the same, it’s difficult to get the hair dye out of your scalp. I scrubbed my hair for days with my fingers and it seemed like everything was gone because the water ran clear. When I received the product I was excited so I am immediately jumped in the shower to use it. To my surprise a ton of hair dye that was stuck on my head came off. Not only that, but my scalp feels breathable and clean. Definitely not greasy 24 hours later like regular shampooing would do for me. I would recommend this product."" —Lisa AgroGet it from Amazon for $7.98+ (available in three colors). | amazon.com, AmazonPromising review: ""I have never felt more compelled to write a product review before. This stuff is INCREDIBLE. I have tried almost everything to improve my skin. I continue to get acne in my mid-30s and literally everything else I've tried has not worked, including prescription topical cream and oral medication. This has saved my skin! I have had very few breakouts, and if anything pops up, this takes care of it quickly! My skin feels moisturized and looks smoother and healthier overall. This is truly one of the best purchases I've ever made. I'm thankful I stumbled upon this serum!"" —J.C. DentonGet it from Amazon for $14.95. | oliveandjune / Via instagram.com, Olive & JuneI recently tried Olive and June's nail polish and was quite impressed. It went on very smoothly and didn't chip even after a week! I love how these colors will brighten up my nails for spring and summer (the mint is already calling my name!). This brand is also proudly 7-free, which means it doesn't contain harmful chemicals that most polishes do.Get it from Olive & June for $56. | Amazon, amazon.comPromising review: ""These eye masks are absolutely amazing! I have hereditary dark circles under my eyes, as well as slight bags from being a mother of four. Eye creams do absolutely nothing for me, and I gave these a try just on a whim, not really expecting much. But they really work! The results aren't permanent, but I put these on for about an hour in the evening while I relax and watch TV, and my under-eyes are much lighter and less puffy. I absolutely love these eye masks, and I will never be without them again."" —Kate JohnsonGet a pack of 12 pairs from Amazon for $23.50. | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF Maitland Quitmeyer / BuzzFeedPromising review: ""This hot air brush has made the biggest difference in my usually flat, frizzy hair! I now have more body and shine than I have had in years! I highly recommend this product. It is lightweight and easy to use. My hair holds a style longer and it is so much easier than trying to blow dry my hair while also using a round brush trying to style it. I wish I would’ve discovered this hot air brush years ago! Love it!"" —LRead our full review of the John Freida Hot Brush for more info!Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in 1 and 1.5-inch versions). | Amazon, amazon.comPromising review: ""A must have in my makeup case! I have used plastic lash combs, metal ones, and flat ones, all of which just didn’t get the job done. I always went back to a safety pin, WHICH I DO NOT ADVISE! This comb is metal and arched, which is much easier to use, and the teeth glide through lashes easily. NOTE: If your mascara is dry and clumped, ANY COMB COULD POTENTIALLY PULL OUT LASHES. JUST NO. DO NOT DO IT. I put on mascara, and while it’s still wet, I glide the comb through the base and go up. It’s that simple. I was concerned about cleaning it with alcohol, but I asked customer service and was told it was safe."" —ASConnerGet it from Amazon for $7.99. | Loops Beauty / Via instagram.com, Loops BeautyI recently gave this mask a go and was super impressed. Usually sheet masks slip and slide off of my face and I have to recline in an awkward position for 10 minutes — but no this one from Loops! It stays in place and includes great ingredients (pumpkin extract, white flower, and baobab oil) that left my face feeling super soft and hydrated. Oh, and the packaging is super cute.Get a five-pack from Loops Beauty for $30. | Glossier, Sarah Han / BuzzFeedMy colleague Sarah Han (as well as MANY other BuzzFeeders) is a big fan of this product. This is what she had to say:""I wasn't a blush person until I met Cloud Paint. Any other attempts at wearing blush always looked super unnatural and accented redness on my face that would, as you might guess, populate in the cheek areas. It was always too much or too little, no in between. Little did I know I needed to say goodbye to powder blushes and let ~gel-cream~ blush into my life. The gel-cream formula just blends so seamlessly, like no other blush I've ever used, and it's a piece of cake to use. It doesn't make pores look more apparent and just gliiiiides over your skin for a dewy-looking flush. And if I have too many glasses of wine, I can blame any flush on the blush.""Get it from Glossier for $18 (available in six shades). | instagram.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""I am lazy and hate doing my makeup, especially after a morning workout on a weekday. I wanted something I could throw in my bag and smear around my eyes in a couple of seconds, and to just add a little color without the fussiness. This fits the bill perfectly. It gives my eyes a little definition, but isn't super noticeable. The slight shimmer also makes me look awake on days where I'm dragging. It is not intensely shiny, though, which is important to me — I'm not a disco ball! It just reflects light and looks luminescent, not glittery. Because this is so easy to use, non-irritating, and is the exact color I was looking for, I expect that I will keep ordering it as long as it's available."" —RachelGet it from Amazon for $4.50+ (available in 23 shades). | lovebeautyandplanet / Via instagram.com, AmazonI'm a sucker for anything made by Love, Beauty and Planet, so you can imagine how thrilled I was to try out this body scrub in my shower. This product is infused with organic coconut oil and Bulgarian roses. It smells AMAZING and leaves my body feeling like velvet — definitely a luxurious add-on for any shower experience.

Mas isso é mais difícil do que parece! | publicado March 20, 2020, 19:29 GMT | March 20, 2020, 19:29 GMT | Emma LordBuzzFeed Staff | Clique para ver o GIFClique para ver o GIF | Clique para ver o GIFClique para ver o GIF | Para deixar claro, o objetivo do lenço ou cachecol é treinar a si mesmo para perceber quando você está tocando o rosto, não para impedir a propagação de germes. Uma das partes do rosto que mais tocamos é a boca, e um lenço ou cachecol que a encubra parcialmente servirá como um sinal de que algo está diferente e talvez lembre você de que não deve tocar o rosto. Se você está procurando um lenço bandana leve e casual que possa usar, aqui tem ofertas na faixa de R$69 e R$20E sim — tecnicamente, as máscaras médicas são um jeito de fazer isso. Mas o CDC recomenda que apenas as pessoas que estão doentes ou que cuidam de doentes usem máscaras no momento e, no ritmo em que as máscaras estão se esgotando, é mais importante que essas pessoas tenham acesso a elas do que o restante da população. | Até que você consiga se treinar para não tocar o rosto, experimente um lembrete tátil que alertará sua consciência para o gesto inconsciente. Uma forma de fazer isso é usando luvas; se você trabalha num escritório, experimente um par de luvas finas e sem dedos (estas para artrite por R$38,55 na Amazon são perfeitas e podem te ajudar a evitar dor) para que ainda possa usar o computador com facilidade, mas perceba o tecido em seu rosto se tocar nele. Se você é mais de comer as peles dos cantos das unhas, experimente uma combinação de lembrete tátil e visual ao colar pedacinhos de fita adesiva colorida nas pontas dos dedos. Você ainda vai conseguir digitar, mas com certeza sentirá a textura estranha se tocar o rosto e, com sorte, notará a cor neon brilhante antes mesmo de chegar a esse ponto. (Este conjunto de fitas adesivas coloridas por R$6,11 na Amazon, deve funcionar.) | super fantástico meu perfil mágico 𓆙@marav1lhosa | super fantástico meu perfil mágico 𓆙 | @marav1lhosa | Nois tá assim o dia todo tentando não tocar no rosto | Responder | Retwittear | Favorito",,"March 20, 2020, 19:29 GMT",

My puppy spent hours playing with the unicorn toys and loved the treats. I adored the necklace and candle and the blessing was so sweet. I am totally in love with this box and it's so reasonably priced! The items are very high quality. It was like present after present that my pup and I opened together. Loved it. Great job!"" —Andrea H.Get it from Cratejoy for $39.95/month. | CratejoyWhat you get: You'll receive all the pre-measured ingredients you need to make baking easy, quick, and fun!

Promising review: ""My wife bought these boxes and I decided to try to make one on my own when she wasn’t home. It’s very rare that I bake, but the directions were easy to follow and she was really surprised by how good I did. Maple pecan mini cakes came out great! And, the box made more mini cakes than it said it was going to. Update: Tried the Chai Tea Latte cupcakes and they came out perfect too.

I had high expectations when I purchased this as Christmas gifts for my two nieces (ages 5 and 6) and nephew (6). I wanted to give them something different. The lessons are deliberate and packaged as fun they can identify with. Who wouldn’t want to be their own superhero? The kids (three different families) constantly send me videos of their projects and their parents all tell me it is the one gift they have been going back to after all the Christmas excitement has settled. The boxes are fun and unique. I love the learning that it's given the kids. As they’ve told me, 'Superheroes have feelings too!'

It’s embarrassing to have guests over because the toilets are so gross! I have tried so many products and cleaning solutions — from natural essential oils to harsh chemicals so strong I was lightheaded for the rest of the day. Well, I tried out this pumice stone after reading about it in a BuzzFeed article, and honestly the hype is real! It does take some elbow grease, but the after picture is from only 20 minutes of scrubbing, light enough that I didn’t break a sweat! The stone does get used up, but I think this one should last me a couple years at least.

After over 10 years of the grout not being cleaned, and a botched repair job, the bathroom floor in this house looked horrendous. Two pens covered the entire bathroom floor, with plenty left over in the second pen, even with applying two to three layers (which you will definitely need as the paint is a bit thin and also absorbs into the grout). Super easy to apply, works exactly like a regular paint marker. Be sure to press the pen tip on a separate (thick) cloth to activate it before actually using on the grout so you don't end up with a huge mess on the tile when the paint floods out at first. If you see the first side of the tip is getting frayed, just pull it out and turn it around to the other side."" —regalleGet it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in two sizes and three colors). | | amazon.comPromising review: ""I recently moved into a home with hard water and the dishwasher needed cleaning.

It works amazingly!! I sprayed it on (it came with a great spray nozzle and a lid) and left it for about 15 to 20 minutes. Then I took a brush with hard plastic bristles (I believe a soft brush would have even worked) and with less than 20 minutes of scrubbing the entire tub and walls it was cleaner than when we moved in.

I even used one on an older stain (that I'm pretty sure wasn't pet related) and it came up after leaving it on for about 24 hours. I make sure to keep a supply of these in the house at all times now."" —MCGet a pack of 20 from Amazon for $24.99. | amazon.comPromising review: ""I’ve been trying to switch all my cleaning products over to biodegradable or biocompatible, but I still expect them to work. I bought this because my shower stall doors are supposed to be transparent but were actually a mess of fog, hard water deposits, and other foul substances. Nothing I used cleaned the doors at all. I tried this and scrubbed my doors twice with it. Not only did it actually clean my doors but it lacks gross fumes and smells quite pleasant."" —A. Via Get it from Amazon for $12.95. | amazon.comPromising review: ""Be sure to use hot water; even though it won't foam as much it seems to do a lot better job. The first time I used these on a Contigo travel mug I used room-temp water, and it just came out OK. For the next travel mug, I used boiling water and the results were terrific. It looks new again. Then I used two cubes (and boiling water) in a large old pressure cooker that had become brown inside from years of making vegetable soups, and I'm amazed how clean it came out. That pressure cooker stain persisted throughout dozens of scrubbing sessions and dishwasher runs, so I figured the Bottle Bright wouldn't help either but it did."" —MisterPlowGet 12 tablets from Amazon for $8. | amazon.comPromising review: ""My shower floor is a bumpy, plastic material that has been a thorn in my side for a couple of years. I have used bleach, chlorine, tile cleaners, Soft Scrub, and Clorox bathroom spray (which usually cleans everything). I have even soaked cloths in bleach and let them sit on the area to see if that would work. None of them have removed the stains. I only had about 10 minutes before having to leave for work, so I only cleaned half so I could see the difference. It was amazing! I sprayed it on, let it sit for about five minutes (not sure if I needed to do that, but figured if bleach wouldn't clean it that nothing would), then used my usual cleaning brush. I didn't even have to scrub....just minimal circular motions and viola! The stains are gone! I couldn't be more pleased. The stains were there for over two years and with only five minutes of sitting and less than a minute of scrubbing, it looks like a new shower again. There are a couple of small areas that probably need a little more brushing, but like I said, I literally spent less than a minute with the brush. I highly recommend this product. And, no, I am not getting paid anything to say this. I very rarely review products unless I believe in them and this one is a keeper!"" —MakadamiaGet it from Amazon for $5.51. | amazon.comPromising review: ""I let my tub get extra dirty on purpose because I knew this brush set was coming. In five minutes my tub was sparkling clean. This item is no joke. The flat brushes are awesome for big surfaces and the cone brush hits the hard to reach corners. I liked them so much I bought a set for my mom."" —Jason B.Get it from Amazon for $14.95+ (available in soft, medium, stiff, and ultra stiff bristles). | amazon.comPromising review: ""This stuff is seriously amazing! I am relentless about cleaning my tub because I use it so often and always get grossed out if I don’t. Before I purchased this, I used the typical homemade recipe of bleach and powdered dishwashing soap. I’d have to run two or three cycles to get it crystal clear. One cycle with this stuff, 15 minutes, and the results are amazing! The first photo (above) is with my tub running with the solution. Then I drained it (second photo) and wiped it down with a sponge. When I refilled the tub up, and reran the jets, I kid you not the water was CRYSTAL CLEAR! See for yourself in the last photo! I’m so impressed!"" —ChelseaGet it from Amazon for $16.99. | amazon.comPromising review: ""This stuff is incredible. My rental apartment has a white glass cooktop and it gets nasty even if you use very clean pots and pans on it. Before I found this stuff, I thought that for sure I would lose a big chunk of my security deposit, but I have yet to encounter a stain that this stuff cannot remove. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries alternating between the paste and the razor scraper, but even the most stubborn burned-on, carbonized food bits always come off."" —MaxGet it from Amazon for $11.03. | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""First, let me say I never clean my oven because hate it so much! It had years of baked-on drippings on the bottom and the usual brown crud that forms on the sides and shelves. After reading reviews, I decided to give it a try. It works wonders! My oven looks great and it was so easy. Follow the directions and all the bad stuff just wipes away! I've even used it on other stubborn stains on baking pans. Highly recommended!!"" —E. NyquistGet it from Amazon for $6.44. | amazon.comPromising review: ""Totally impressed!

I can find my socks, hose, bras, and scarves again! Great organizers! It helps clear clutter and makes putting together great outfits so much easier! So glad I got them! I hope to order more! Also, no more solo socks!"" —H.j.Get a set of four from Amazon for $12.97+ (available in seven colors). | | AmazonPromising review: ""It was always a pain to reach down the side of my bed to reach my chargers, not to mention the wad of cables I’d have to sift through just to charge my phone. I finally searched for a solution and came across these. They’re great! They’re really easy to stick on and they stay in place. I haven’t had an issue of them falling off. Whenever I need to charge a device they’re right next to me, easy to reach and untangled. I definitely recommend!"" —Nelis PerezGet a pack of six from Amazon for $6.97. | amazon.comPromising review: ""I love the crap out of this thing! I have so many camis that I use as undershirts for work and they were always being folded up and crammed into a drawer, taking up way too much space. After putting away half of my shirts on this two-pack, I knew I needed to buy another pack! It's so easy to take the shirts on and off without messing around with any of the others. This organizer is perfect for my needs in freeing up a drawer and taking up little space in my closet."" —TessaGet a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99+. | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""Exactly as advertised! I've got mine on the counter, with the feet on it, but I'm considering taking them off and sliding it in the cupboard. Right now the novelty and organizational prettiness of it has me smitten. I'd say it's pretty much exactly worth the price, and this was the best price everywhere I looked, even including places where I could have used a 20% coupon."" —Gigi Marie Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in black, red and white). | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""These come with their hangers and will add considerable storage. I put one on the inside of our pantry door and the second on the back of the door going from laundry room to garage. I initially was interested in getting one for the pantry, but the second was a nice bonus and it makes a great place to hold cleaning supplies. Well-made, excellent price."" —KimberleeGet a two-pack from Amazon for $12.97. | amazon.com, AmazonPromising review: ""Sturdy! The weight limit says 30 lbs., but I'm 99% sure I'm over that and the bar is still straight as a board. I recommend measuring the distance from your main closet bar, the average length of the clothes, and seeing if the remaining length leaves enough room for the second row to hang without touching the floor (unless you don't mind it)."" —M. GeeGet it from Amazon for $22.04. | AmazonPop them right out when you need to clean them!Promising review: ""This is one of my favorite things I've ever purchased from Amazon! The fact that they are so customizable allows you to cut them for any drawer size! I think this will be my go-to gift for all of my friends who love cooking as much as I do! Freeing up cabinet space and having something that can easily be rinsed off in the sink makes this a for-sure buy!"" —momononoGet a pack of six on Amazon for $15.99. | AmazonPromising review: ""THESE ARE SO MUCH BIGGER AND NICER IN PERSON!! Really, they are so great! I love them! And yes, I am a grown-up but I thought they would make storing stuff at my office more fun and they stack easily. I WAS RIGHT!! SO MUCH FUN AND REALLY HANDY! Whether you buy them for your kids or you buy them for yourself, they are GREAT for storage and stack just like giant Legos and are SO WORTH THE MONEY!!"" —Sean T. FlynnGet them from Amazon for $10.49+ (available in small, medium, and large sizes and in a variety of colors). | AmazonPromising review: ""It is so great to have a high-quality knife set. The pieces have a very nice weight to them. The various knives make easy work when cutting/slicing both uncooked and meats, seafood, bread, tomatoes, onions — heck, everything I've cut thus far has been a breeze. Also, the knife block continually sharpens the pieces. Literally the best set I've owned. Love them."" —MeSharonnaGet a 15-piece set from Amazon for $112.99. | AmazonPromising review (for the over-the-door organizer): ""Oh my goodness, I should've gotten something like this long ago. Everything is available at a glance and it's all organized. I don't have to take everything out of my cupboard just to find the one I'm looking for. And it doesn't take up tons of space in my coat closet. I can do a quick inventory of what I'm running out of. It's also a great place to keep a pair of scissors and tape high up out of the reach of my toddlers."" —daiseyworldGet the organizer from Amazon for $8.14 and the over-the-door organizer for $13.32. There's also a really great gift bag organizer if that's more your jam. | AmazonPromising review: ""Love these sooo much I bought three! I use them to hold rice, homemade breadcrumbs, and coconut flour. The caps make a nice airtight lid and they're very convenient to use, always right where you need them to be. The sizing on the bin itself is a little tall, so I store these lying down in my cabinets, otherwise, they don't fit. If you are looking for something to store your grains/powders/crumbs/seeds/cereal/whatever in, these bins are AWESOME."" —ChrisGet it from Amazon for $12.95. | amazon.com, AmazonPromising review: ""I love it!! I wanted to do a huge apartment cleanse and finally get everything organized and orderly. My apartment's shelving and cabinets are awkward but this product does the trick and allows me to utilize the dead space underneath my sink. Now I don't have to sift around when I need something, I can see where it is! One of the shelves did have a minor dent when it arrived, but I don't really care since it's an under-the-sink shelving unit. It has not comprised the quality or function of this product."" —XtinaGet it from Amazon for $19.87+ (available in three finishes). | AmazonPromising review: ""It actually fits my size 13 shoes! Not a fan of the color but when something this useful comes along for me, who cares? I mean, it is behind the closet door. I recommend this for anyone who has large feet and is looking for an over-the-door shoe organizer."" —C. CurateGet it from Amazon for $24.95 (available in two colors). | marthastewart.com, AmazonGet the storage container from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in four colors). | AmazonPromising review: ""They have been working wonderfully. Having lots of vegetables chopped up and easily accessible without opening several containers has really sped up our morning lunch preparation time."" —Magen R.Get a set of two from Amazon for $29.65+. | AmazonPromising review: ""Just purchased my second set of these — they are perfect! I use them to protect my good frying pans, my Dutch ovens, nice glass bowls — anything where stacking is needed for space but I was worried about scratching. I love the neutral color, but with a cute, all-over pattern, and the size is great for deep bowls to protect the sides or large pans. Plus they are definitely the most cost-effective ones out there. I plan to buy more and also use as an add-on gift when giving cookware."" —Sno-cone loverGet a set of six from Amazon for $9.69+ (available in six sizes). | AmazonPromising review: ""This is the product I didn’t know always needed. The little map is so cute and both my 1-year-old and 4-year-old enjoy playing. The best part is when they’re done I just pull the drawstring and clean up is over. It makes moving the play space and cleaning up so easy. I wish I found this before. Highly recommend."" —AnonymousGet it from Amazon for $39.99. | Amazon, amazon.comPromising review: ""The perfect thing for all the remotes! Attractive, sturdy, plus well-made and stylish.

Some of the cards were quick and straightforward, while other were more thought provoking. We got some good laughs out of this and it was truly a refreshing change compared to our previous casual conversations.

It makes lighting candles a breeze. Yes, there is a weird crackling noise, but that's a super minor annoyance. It's a super intuitive device.

After many years of using Outlook, CRM, etc, sometimes it's just nice to go back to what has always worked well since the beginning of time! Why complicate things right?

I recently tried my first Billie razor and, OMG, my legs have never been smoother. They seriously have a handle style for everyone — including their new ""Glow"" razor that, you guessed it, glows in the dark! My coworker Rachel Dunkel is also a BIG fan of Billie razors and their other products. Here's what she had to say:""For the last five years or so, I haven't cared that much about shaving. I'd let my legs and pits grow into a (beautiful!) forest, but whenever I craved a nice, smooth shave and picked up a razor from the drugstore, I'd end up disappointed. Even with more expensive razor brands, I'd still be prickly and end up regretting ever shaving in the first place. I have never, ever had that problem with Billie. Ever since trying their razors and shave cream, I've actually *wanted* to keep up with shaving. You get a ridiculously smooth result on the first go, even if your hair is super grown out. But most importantly, it STAYS that way for way longer than with other brands. With Billie, it actually feels worth the time and money to shave, something that I could never say about any other razor.""Check out our full review on the Billie razor subscription here.Get it from Billie for $9+ (available in six colors). | amazon.com, AmazonHonestly, no matter which version of the Dyson stick vacuum you purchase, I can promise you'll be satisfied with the results. I've used a variety of 'em and I can't say enough good things about the product. It doesn't hurt my back to use for an extended period of the time, the battery lasts long enough to clean my entire apartment, and it simply just WORKS. We have ours mounted in a narrow spot alongside our fridge — it's really easy to keep in plain sight without being an eyesore.Promising review: ""I love this vacuum. The V10 doesn't disappoint. While it's weird to get used to holding this tiny piece of machinery, it really does an amazing job. It was incredible how much dog fur it picked up! I was pretty grossed out to be honest, to think I lived in this atmosphere for this long 'thinking' it was clean is nuts! I love all the attachments too, they are all top notch and well made. I feel like I can tackle my entire house with this bad boy. AND it's lightweight! I use it on the lowest setting and it still picks up a ton. I don't think I'll ever need the high or medium setting.

The only thing I was concerned about when I ordered the gloves was if I was buying the right size. My husband and I have different hand sizes, but the medium is working well for both of us.

Pot holder pockets still work length-wise for me and I have not gotten a stain or ruined my actual clothing since I got this.

Thank you, Lelo."" —crystal413Get it from Target for $99 or from Lelo for $99 (three colors). | BabelandPromising review: ""This dildo has absolutely no chill, and is not for most people. However, for those folks who want: G-spot rollercoasters, foot-kicking stimulation, a toy that heats up with your body, girthy sensations, potential gushing, then try this toy out. The groove in the center of the toy acts like a lube slide. Use this with thick cilicone lube like Back Door or Uber Lube, you're welcome. The toy is wider than it is long, which gives a unique girthy sensation without adding much size because it hugs the pubic bone and spreads the pressure out, instead of most cylinder-style toys. G-spotting is going to be done with the texture and the pressure. This toy will hug and pump the whole G-spot instead of many other G-spotters that centralize the pressure with a single ridge or bump. This toy will up your game. Also, it looks like a tentacle which is hot."" —AnonymousGet it from Babeland for $78. | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF instagram.com, instagram.comThe Womanizer's unique air action draws your clit inside with gentle suction, then it surrounds your most sensitive spot with incredible pressure waves.Promising review (for the Womanizer Preimum): ""OMG, this is amazing.

As you can see the light button has rubbed off a bit because I use it so much! It has all colors of the rainbow, it goes for 11 hours, is easy to clean, and it looks great. Other diffusers I just couldn’t say the same about. The only thing that I do have to warn is that you need to be careful about the oils you put in it or it can be ruined (from experience). This has lasted me sooo long and I am going to buy again! My sister bought first then I did she was bummed when hers no longer worked (from the bad oils)! Definitely recommend!!"" —Happy Mom of 3Get them from Amazon: diffuser for $15.99+ (available in four colors) and eight essential oils for $14.95 | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""These masks are amazing!!! Having 'ice pick' scars left over from acne I was told that I'd have to pay for expensive laser therapy because the body can't produce enough collagen to heal deep scars. I've been using these masks for two months and I've seen SIGNIFICANT reduction in my scars. They are almost completely gone!"" —ShaunGet them from Amazon for $10.99. | amazon.com, AmazonGet it from Amazon for $9.59+ (available in seven styles).Though if you're more into The Office, check out some versions with Prison Mike and Dwight wearing the CPR dummy mask. | AmazonGet three pens of varying brush sizes from Amazon for $6.99. | AmazonGet them from Amazon for $5.99+ (available in gold or black). | amazon.com, AmazonPromising review: ""Our son has been into comic drawing lately and he would draw his own lines/boxes on paper he stapled together!

He loves it!"" —Ebiel and Erica CamachoGet it from Amazon for $5.99. | Amazon, amazon.comBTW, lots of reviewers have found success mixing this powder mask with organic ACV.Promising review: ""I use the clay mask along with apple cider vinegar and let it sit on my face for 20–30 mins. I have been using it every single day but if you have sensitive skin, I don't recommend that. Tbh I have not been eating healthy 24/7 but it still works. Some days I forgot to put in on but in total I have used this mask over 10x. Just be patient and give it time."" —Delandia StevensonGet it from Amazon for $9.99. | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""I have two cats, tried a de-shedder brush but they hate it and hide the second I take it out, so I was looking for other options and saw these gloves — it turned out to be a life-changer! To my surprise, cats absolutely love it! They even purr and roll around to make sure I didn't miss a spot. The layer of fur is easy to peel off from the glove and the more you collect the easier it gets. Now I am able to bru­sh my cats every oth­er day, since they enjoy it so much, which means less fur on my clothes and everywh­ere else. Very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to cat owners."" —YanaGet a pair from Amazon for $12.99 (available in two colors). | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""I use this whenever I feel tired, and always after I’ve cleansed my face. I use rubbing alcohol to clean it after use and then put it back in the freezer in its own ziplock. I notice it’s helped with the redness in my face and it also helped when I’ve had migraines. It starts behind my eye so I roll it over whichever side of my head is in pain and it seems to help."" —maihiroGet it from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in eight color combos).",,"January 29, 2020, 03:00 GMT",

I no longer wanted our vinyl stacked and I was sick and tired of others flipping through them on the floor and then leaving them in a state of chaos. I have to say, we absolutely love these and will likely be purchasing more in the near future! They have exceeded my expectations. I love the practical, minimalist design. And my friends can now easily flip through our collection and play records without using our floor."" —Kaci B.Get it from Amazon for $25+ (available in six finishes and two sizes). | NisoloPromising review: ""I got these for my husband for Christmas and he's worn them almost every day.

It also comes with sweet postcards from the cities where the batches are from, so the entire experience feels so lovely and personal. As for the coffee itself, it's heavenly. I am used to store-bought coffee — which yes, is fine — but both of these tasted incredibly fresh and different from each other. The Peruvian coffee has this dark, almost chocolate taste to it, so I imagine it would be delicious with a morning sweet treat (maybe I should start eating pie every day?). The Colombian batch, on the other hand, was a little lighter roast-wise but still had delicious notes of rich sweetness. TL;DR: both of them were incredible both in taste and quality."" —Kayla SuazoGet a subscription from Atlas for $9+/month.And check out our full review of the Atlas coffee subscription here. | YetiPromising review: ""Perfect for my daily lunch.

As another reviewer said, I also purchased the Merry Products Cat Washroom to house the unit. It hides it perfectly, and it looks nice in a living area rather then trying to find a place to hide a box. Additionally, I also purchased a forever tray to use instead of having to repeatedly buy disposable trays.

I’m a performer at Walt Disney World, and a clear complexion is required. Last night, I put these on a few acne problems (a small cyst, a whitehead, and a pimple I shouldn’t have picked and has been a bump for about three weeks now). I just woke up and am writing this review in disbelief. THEY'RE FLAT! Gone! All of them! I could cry I’m so happy. The packaging is also ideal because it allows you to conveniently and easily peel the stickers off without stretching them out or folding them back on themselves. Do yourself and your complexion a huge favor! Have these on hand for a stubborn zit when you really need help. Make sure you apply them to completely clean and dry skin."" —CaitlynGet a 40-pack from Amazon for $8.50. | amazon.comPromising review: ""After seeing it say it only takes two minutes (mine was closer to four) I thought there was no way it would work. But I can literally hear how much easier the disposal spins. I can see the metal which used to be black. I'm in an apartment where it has probably never been cleaned. I didn't even know the second sink drain was white until this. It had a layer of brown gunk. Simply amazing, I'm shocked how well this stuff works."" —J. PeaceGet a pack of four from Amazon for $5.94. | | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""I bought this in charcoal and lost it on a trip, so I bought the exact color again because I missed it so much. Now I'm back to buy it in more colors. It is thick (because it's a watch cap) but I wear it year round in Dallas or Chicago. The fit is snug to the point that I can sling it back without it falling off and it fits over my afro or straight hair the same and doesn't lose is stretch after washing. This is my favorite hat."" —CEGet it from Amazon for $14.99 (available in 36 colors). | amazon.comPromising review: ""I seriously can't believe how well these little tablets work. I had the most disgusting HydroFlask coffee mug – I tried everything. Bottle brush, different kinds of soap, vinegar, EVERYTHING, and there was still a seemingly impenetrable layer of black sludge inside. It grossed me out so much that I bought ANOTHER HydroFlask to replace it. Now eventually they both got black inside, so I tried these little magic tablets. I let a tablet sit in each of my mugs for an hour or two, and the black sludge rinsed out COMPLETELY, without even scrubbing. They look brand new. What a magical product. No weird smell or taste afterward, either. I liked it so much I used it on another HydroFlask I use primarily to hold my Bloody Mary mix in the fridge. I couldn't put anything else in it because it would always taste like spicy tomato juice. Bottle Bright to the rescue! No residual smell or taste anymore. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING."" —Amazon CustomerGet a pack of 12 from Amazon for $8. | BlissPromising review: ""This is hands down the best cleanser I have ever used.

Follow the instructions and this will save you time and sanity in the kitchen! Roll it with minimal pressure and it works like a champ. It also rinses very easily and dries quick. The case has holes on either end to ensure it dries completely in between uses when you toss it in a drawer.

I’m 5’7 148 lbs (athletic build) 34DD, and I ordered a small. It’s oversized, so the small is perfect. I’d recommend sizing down one from your usual size.

I got a large (150lb, 5'4) and it fits me perfectly. I've had this black skirt for around nine months now and it has become a staple in my wardrobe! It has very VERY small pockets but pockets nonetheless, and it's very comfortable. The zipper is high quality, the material feels expensive, and I haven't noticed any fabric shrinkage or color fading! For me, it hits around mid-thigh."" –livGet it from Amazon for $18.99 (available in sizes XS-2XL and 20 styles). | amazon.com, AmazonReviewers recommend ordering a half size down. Promising review: ""These shoes are affordable, comfortable, and really cute! I had been looking for a loafer shoe, and these looked promising. They have a tiny heel that's just right, so not completely flat and not too high. The pointed toe makes these more modern and dressy. I took into consideration other reviews on size. I normally wear an 8 1/2 up to a 9, especially in dress shoes. I went with an 8 and they fit perfect, despite having a wider width foot. I plan on regularly wearing them to work. I'll update my review if they don't hold up, but they seem decently made."" —VansGet them from Amazon for $34.99 (available in sizes 6-11 and in 35 styles). | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""This is probably the most comfortable jacket I have ever owned!

I now have two pairs and will continue to buy from this brand. They fit perfectly and don't slide down or ride up as I work out. They also do well with wicking moisture and staying dry—no puddles of sweat to make me uncomfortable! I can't tell you how many times I've worn and washed them and they hold up perfectly. They're perfectly opaque too. No panty lines and definitely no patterns on my underwear showing through. I'm so impressed with 90 Degree by Reflex, especially for the price.

So comfortable, so cute—just enough stretch so you can move around easily, without that saggy, baggy butt look after a few hours, lol.

The material is so soft and comfortable, and the dress is a perfect fit. It accentuates my curves and is super flattering. I always try to find dresses that would be work appropriate and also cute to wear if going out after work and on the weekends, and this fits the bill. It doesn't show too much cleavage and is the perfect length- a few inches above my knee."" —TaylorGet it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in sizes S-XXL and in 22 styles). | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""I really love this dress. It is very beautiful. It fit just right. I ordered an XL, and I am 203lbs, and I am busty, so the boob area was very comfortable. The dress itself was comfortable!! It did fall a little below my knees, which was a great length. It had a zipper on the side, but I didn’t use it because I didn’t even notice it had a zipper because the dress was stretchy. I will be buying again in other colors.

I took it to the dealership to see if they could get it out and they flat out told me no, so I gave up and lived with it for almost five years. Then I tried this after it was recommended by a friend.

You'll have to re-stamp every 12 days or so, depending on how often the toilet's flushed. Oh, and make sure to stamp it somewhere it won't become a, well, ""target"" and get sprayed off before its time. Promising review: ""A lazy housekeepers best friend — these are amazing and I'm bummed I haven't tried them until now! Warning: possible TMI! We're big fans of the 'if it's yellow, let it mellow' potty practice in our home as it conserves a serious amount of water if you flush every 3-4 tinkles vs every time....anyways!

Promising review: ""A super time saver. It legitimately used to take us hours to clean all the blinds. My wife now does all the faux-wood Venetian blinds in the house in about one hour.

I have a rose de France amethyst wedding ring and the stone was so cloudy it looked terrible. I kept trying to clean it with a toothbrush and warm water/mild soap as I was instructed when it was purchased. It would get clean but I couldn't get behind the stone so it would never really look clean. I used this product and once it was rinsed and dry it looked just like the day I received it. I was so excited! Fell back in love with my ring again and can't stop looking at it.

Promising review: ""Do you have a stinky garbage disposal? If so, get some of these. They are cheap, smell nice. and the foaming action really provides you with a visual they are cleaning the drain. After using these the garbage disposal seems smoother (fewer strange noises, like it's been lubricated).

I can cook whatever I want and know the pan will be as good as new. For people that worry about the seasoning on the pan, this definitely won't hurt a thing. Once I'm done cleaning, I'll shake off any excess water and then heat it on the stove top for a minute until its completely dry. I'll then put a a very light coating of oil on it and heat it up again and the pan will be good to go for the next use. My pan has never cooked better."" —JoshGet it on Amazon for $15.99.

Next, I tackled the tub — once, no doubt, a lovely porcelain fixture but now with worn-down porcelain that wants to hold onto every smudge of dirt or stain. Again, the sponge worked! It really did clean up, if not so sparkly white. I even considered taking a bath again, which I hated to do before."" —PeninaGet a pack of eight on Amazon for $10. | amazon.comBecause it doesn't rely on adhesive paper, you only have to buy it once and use it forever — cleaning the hair off the brush when it gets clogged, of course! Promising review: ""We live in a household that contains two humans, two dogs, and two cats. It's a real Noah's Ark furnished with a black sectional couch. Our dogs absolutely hate the vacuum. So much so they will attack the cleaner head with their vicious bite even before we power it on. This makes the task of cleaning our couch extremely unpleasant and nearly impossible. Thanks to Chom Chom, we no longer have this problem! With a simple, quick, SOUNDLESS sweep, we're able to keep our couch pet-hair-free in blissful peace. This tool does an amazing job picking up pet hair but not so much with crumbs. We were so impressed, we gifted these as Christmas presents for all of our pet-loving friends."" —MagpieGet one on Amazon for $24.95. | amazon.comPromising review: ""These towels are awesome for so many things. They are large and very sturdy, so they work well for household cleaning. The real benefit for me, though, is having a wipe that works for things like the grill, the oven, the dashboard of my car, muddy shoes, chairs and umbrellas that go to soccer games and practices, and lawn furniture. I frequently wipe something down, rinse the towel, and wipe again. The wipes are heavy enough to go through three to four rinses and wipes and still hold up. The smell is mild and doesn't linger on my hands or what I've wiped down. Because the canister is heavier than most, and the lid fits well, it's easy to throw one of these in the trunk or cargo area without worrying about leaks. The canister's recyclable when the towels are gone — an added bonus."" —COMomGet a tub on Amazon for $11.75. | amazon.comPromising review: ""I have a 19-year-old master bathroom toilet that had accumulated some nasty stains over time which regular toilet brushes and cleaning products just would not remove. Pumice stone worked like a charm! Given the nature and severity of the stains, it required some elbow grease, but 10 minutes later I have a new-looking bowl, and I see no signs of scratching. Am very happy with this purchase...well worth the very low price!"" —Happy RetireeGet one on Amazon for $7.99. | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF",,"January 22, 2020, 12:56 GMT",

Not only is it extremely adorable, but it also has survived plenty of walks in the rain and still looks like it's in the same condition as the day I got it. Best of all, I can throw everything I need for the day into the bag and there always still seems to be more room for more items. Just this week, I tossed everything in the image above in my bag like I do every morning before work, before realizing I also needed to bring extra hairspray, deodorant, and my makeup bag. All of those things also fit in this bag, and it was so nice to not have to carry a bunch of bags around on my commute! I really recommend this laptop bag for a stylish option that is well within anyone's budget. Woo!"" —Anna KopskyGet it from Amazon for $25.99+ (available in four colors). | ""If you’re familiar with the pearly world of teeth whitening, then you already know it’s a sensitive process. And if you see your dentist and go the professional route, it can also be an expensive one. That's why I decided to try GlowUp when I noticed my teeth looking a little yellow. It's an LED whitening kit that is fully customized to your mouth. To start, you take a comprehensive quiz, answering questions about your brushing habits and how discolored your chompers currently are. Once you're done, you get a specific formula shipped to you.Glowup costs $60 for a one-time kit, or $30 if you sign up for a bimonthly subscription, which is around what you’ll spend for most at-home whitening kits. A treatment takes only 10 minutes (compared with overnight trays or strips you keep on for 30 minutes to an hour). My blend included hydrogen peroxide (the whitening ingredient commonly used by dentists), menthol (to provide a refreshing minty sensation), and cellulose gum (to fight off irritation and discomfort). For anyone who’s all about natural ingredients, Glowup also utilizes pomegranate seed extract, chamomile flower, and aloe leaf juice to remove bacteria and disinfect breath.I love a schedule: setting one and keeping one. So brushing my teeth at night and using the kit was a cinch. I’d apply my custom gel to the mouthguard, set a timer for 10 minutes, and plug the cord directly into my iPhone’s charging port. It truly was that easy. For such a mindless process, I saw a significant difference in the color of my teeth after a week of daily use. Seeing that I’ve never used a whitening light before, I was skeptical. But the results were obvious and I now have refill gels shipped to me for touchups."" —Alexandra Napoli Get a kit from Glowup for $60, or $30 if you sign up for a subscription (with refills for $10). | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF | Kaysey Davis/BuzzFeed""I love a good sheet mask, and the Garnier Moisture Bomb sheet mask is one of my absolute favourites. Unlike other masks that are made of microgel, cellulose, or foil, this mask is made out of cotton, which is not only super soft, but more environmentally friendly. The cotton has a bit of stretch to it, so it's easier to fit it around my face, nose, and lips than other masks. It's also very gentle on the skin and less irritating than other mask materials, so it's great for anyone with sensitive skin. I have oily/combination skin, so my cheeks and chin tend to be drier than the T-zone. I love using the Pomegranate sheet mask to boost the moisture levels in my skin, but all the different types of masks are equal when it comes to hydration. I can just sit back and relax while my skin soaks up all the liquid goodness. Even after I remove the mask, there is so much product left on my skin and in the package that I use it the excess serum on my neck. I can immediately see brighter, smoother, and more hydrated skin after just 15 minutes on my face. I use them a couple times a week before I go to bed, so I wake up with my skin at its best."" —Kaysey DavisGet a six-pack from Amazon for $14.94 (also available in four other varieties). | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF | Tap to play or pause GIFTap to play or pause GIF",,"January 06, 2020, 12:20 GMT",

Plus, it's quicker than using a dryer and then a flat iron or curling iron, which equals less heat damage. Promising review: ""Just wow! I was skeptical at first. I wish I would have bought this sooner! After showering I get all the moisture I can out of my hair. And leave it to kind of air dry while I’m getting ready, having coffee, or whatever I’m doing that morning. It takes me about seven minutes to dry my hair if that!

Are you skeptical when it comes to buying stuff online? ME TOO! That's why I figured all of these rave reviews were a crock of crap. I've seriously bought every kind of vacuum out there, including the Rumba, which is about as intelligent as a cotton swab. But I have four cats and a golden retriever, so I was getting desperate! I believe the saying is… a picture is worth a thousand words. Check mine out (above)! Of note — the 'before' picture was taken of my dog's bed AFTER it went through the washer and dryer. Look at all of that left-behind hair!!! And the 'after' picture was taken after only THREE MINUTES spent vacuuming her bed. I. Am. SOLD!

It snowed a few days later and we put them on again and ended up walking six miles without any sore or red spots on his feet after. I did make it a point to not laugh at him and only put them on for fun stuff. He’s getting to the point where he knows they mean fun and will even give me his paws so I can put them on. You have to make sure that you tighten them enough, but once they are on, they should stay.

I work in cosmetics and wear a lot of makeup daily; this machine did wonders for my skin. It removed about 90% of the makeup with maybe a tiny residue left that I easily went over with a waterproof makeup remover. I am sold on the Foreo and now recommend it to everyone. I even purchased a second one for my husband."" —Andrea SandovalGet it from Amazon for $119+ (available in eight colors).Read our in-depth review of the Foreo Luna Mini 2 for more deets. | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""I was skeptical like many others, but this bag is magical, I think! The cats fought over who got to sit/sleep on it straight out of the package, and they don't mind being zipped up in it at all! I used it two days ago to cut their nails — first time I was able to cut them by myself! There are two Velcro slots at the front on each side for their paws to come out. This morning, I used the bag to apply medicine to their ears by myself...super easy! It's made of a heavyweight-type fabric that keeps their feet secure so they don't run away, and protects you from their sharp nails. No, it doesn't protect you from biting, but I don't know of anything reasonable that does. But for normal cats, who just don't like to be 'fiddled' with, this bag is a godsend. I highly recommend it!"" —K. ZaineaGet it from Amazon for $38.95+ (available in sizes S–XL and eight colors). | amazon.com, AmazonPromising review: ""I was a bit skeptical about this because I thought it was just a glorified metal stick for $7. My tongue would be pretty dirty and white, and could never really be fully cleaned with a toothbrush. After purchasing and using it, I only wish I got it sooner, and it's one of my best purchases. It is just a single piece of metal but it has a an edge that's just sharp enough to scrape all the nasty stuff off without hurting. It takes a few days to get used to but I don't have much problem using it to clean deep in the back of my tongue. It's easy to clean and all the dirt rinses right off. I would highly recommend this; there's really nothing else that has done a good as a job cleaning my tongue."" —AlanGet it from Amazon for $6.95. | amazon.comPromising review: ""I was skeptical of products like this, but I figured it was cheap enough to try. I'm SO glad I did! I always have what I call 'fluh fluhs' coming out of the part on my head and no matter how many times I wet them down they stick straight up again. This product sticks them down and they stay down! The only caution I would give is that there's a little learning curve of how hard to press the wand to your hair. I find that I need a very light touch or I get too much of the product in my hair, which then looks a little greasy. If you wipe the brush as you pull it out you should be ok — just like mascara! Great buy!"" —tinyntuffGet it from Amazon for $7.98. | amazon.comPromising review: ""Totally impressed! The unassuming generic packaging and label left me a bit skeptical but this stuff is almost as exciting as the wine I spilled!

I will be buying more from this line for sure."" —Amazon CustomerGet it from Amazon for $28. | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""I was highly skeptical given A. This is just shampoo B. Most of the reviews mentioned fleas and not ticks C. My dog was FULL of ticks... I mean at least 15-20 that I could see. I would have to warn you, that after using this shampoo, keep your dog OUTSIDE for 24 to 48 hours. I did not. In fact, I came home to a plethora of dead ticks in my living room. Dead ticks EVERYWHERE. I counted at least 10 little ones.. and the big ones... dear god... my dog found them before i could and burst them... leaving blood everywhere.

I have tried the regular strength Easy-Off and was disappointed so when I came across this I was skeptical, but after reading the views, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did; this did wonders for my oven. Cleaned all the stuck-on spots that other cleaners missed with ease. I let it sit for two hours and tested a small section and I was pleased with the results so far so i let it sit overnight and almost all of it came off with no problem. I did have to scrub some off but not like other products. This is a life saver."" —trisha skubiszGet it from Amazon for $5.99. | AmazonPromising review: ""This stuff works! My silver lab was losing fur on both sides of his torso (color dilute alopecia) so I researched a bit and found this item. He had lost so much fur on his sides that you could see his skin. I was skeptical it would live up to all the good reviews but I was desperate. Not only did it work, but it exceeded my expectations! After about three weeks of daily use I started to notice a difference. After six weeks, not only had his fur totally grown back, but it was thicker and shinier than ever. People have started commenting on how soft and shiny his fur is! I can’t recommend this product strongly enough!"" —Michelle ElliottGet it from Amazon for $15.77. | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""This is amazing quality; I'm surprised it worked especially with the price. I was so scared and skeptical since I have extremely sensitive teeth! The first few times you feel like some stains were lifted and others weren't, so you think it looks blotchy. Don't be scared; its lifting the really bad stains first!! And the blotchiness you feel is there but goes away after the next treatment. It worked in four days; i saw the difference in my teeth. No Photoshop needed! I'm continuing to use it and reordering refills :)"" —Angela G ♡Get it from Amazon for $39.99. | amazon.com, amazon.comPromising review: ""I was initially skeptical of how well this kit would work (I mean, it was only $20!) and I wasn’t sure if the foggy-ness on my headlights was inside the lens or on the outside. But after seeing it for myself, I am now a believer! Seriously though, for $20, it makes it look like you basically have a brand new pair of lights! It is *so* worth the purchase. I’d highly recommend it, and whenever it wears off, I will certainly be purchasing another kit and doing this again."" —KysondraGet it from Amazon for $19.99. | amazon.comPromising review: ""It’s been great to use for tons of things other than fungal problems. I was a little skeptical essential oils would do the trick, but this pushed me to do a little more research. The tea tree oil is at a high enough concentration that it is a very mild analgesic and overall it seems to help my skin recover, so I’ve been using it on cuts/scrapes once they’ve started closing. I’ve also had some luck using it to control underarm odor that is usually pretty difficult to control (I usually need to use products with aluminum). The last thing I’ll mention is a little embarrassing, but up until I used this I had trouble completely controlling or getting rid of belly button odor (I recently lost weight and all that loose skin means a cave of a belly button, so just cleaning it in the shower and when I washed my face at night wasn’t doing it). I slap a little bit of this stuff in there at night and no more problem!"" —Grant SyrinGet it from Amazon for $34.97. | amazon.com, amazon.comIt comes with both a 15x macro lens (for close-up shots) and a 45x wide angle lens as well as a rechargeable LED light clip, a charging cable, a lanyard, a cleaning cloth, and a case.

I FINALLY FOUND THE PERFECT WIDE LENS. I got a cheaper one and the quality was so bad and the edges were black, BUT XENVO IS PERFECT. Easy to put on the phone (I have the iPhone XS) and they give you the macro lens, a light (it comes in handy!) and a freaking travel kit with a lanyard. I actually lost my lanyard but I emailed them and they will be sending me a new one for free. I’m so happy I made the choice to buy it.

I was hella skeptical because my thighs are resistant to any sort of chub rub defense. I wore them while walking at least five hours at a music festival and they stayed put without me ever needing to adjust them! I couldn't believe it! My delicate inner thigh skin was preserved; not a chub-rub in sight and they're so feminine and romantic-looking that I didn't even care if someone caught a peek at that beautiful lace.

The man o' war's tentacles can grow to 165 feet in length and deliver a venom that can kill small fish and other small creatures.

It has a fantastic citrus scent. This takes care of any stain so fast and efficiently, it's become a party trick. I have seriously poured red wine over a white comforter to demonstrate how great it is. It is a miracle in a bottle!

The Swiffer is so easy: no bending, no rinsing out, no wringing. I just put a wet pad on, run it over the floors, and they come out clean. When the pad gets dirty, you just change it.

I used this product on it and the oak wood literally came alive, showing the beautiful grain and texture of the wood. I have since used it on my oak kitchen cabinets and they look AMAZING!

Our dog has been bringing in mud and jumping on our bed right after. Washing with detergent alone didn't remove the stains very well. I washed it with some of this stuff and all of it came out. I couldn't see where the stains previously were.

I came back and purchased one for my neighbor and sent one to my favorite pet rescue down south. I am always amazed at what this picks up even after I just ran the vacuum.

After seeing the results, I couldn't help but spread the word. Sure, it took some beer, a little John Mayer, and a lot of elbow grease, but I got the job done, thanks to this handy little product. It did require two treatments; however, given the circumstances, this product accomplished quite a feat in just an hour.

We were all standing around in utter shock and delight before running around trying the cloths on other stuff: the TV, the picture glass, etc. I know it sounds corny, but I couldn't wait to get up this morning, because I woke up in the middle of the night excitedly thinking about trying it on the car today.

Promising review: ""Have long hair? Have you killed other vacuums with your (slightly worrying amount) of shedding? Then look no further. We bought a another Bissell vacuum a year ago, and it didn't take long for my long hair to just kill the little vacuum. Now, we have this vacuum and our apartment is actually clean because my hair is not too much for it. The bristles have grooves that prevent hair from caking on, and it's very easy to clean. The brushes are also adjustable, so you can really get into the carpet if you want. It's also pretty light for something so heavy duty. For the price, it's a great vacuum and would really work if your place isn't very big, as the cord isn't super long."" —J. HallerGet it from Amazon for $92.70. | amazon.comPromising review: ""This works extremely well. We haven't done any cleaning on our dishwasher in five years, and the sliding dish trays were tough to pull out or push in, there was detergent build-up all over the inside, and there was a milky film on all our cups. I bought Affresh, ran the dishwasher with two tablets while it was empty, and the difference was astounding. There was still some build-up and I figured it would require another cycle, so I popped another two tablets in, ran the machine a second time, and now it looks and sounds brand-new. No more film on the glasses, no more dirty dishes from clogged sprayers, no more odors, or build-up around the door seals. I'm going to be buying Affresh from now on, and hopefully it will extend the life of my dishwasher."" —MartouneGet it from Amazon for $3.71. | amazon.comPromising review: ""I used it on our tubs, toilets, sinks, and shower.

Not all slip dresses are made equal though — cheap material, unflattering cuts — but this one here is the crème de la crème. Cut from pure silk in a form-flattering silhouette, its midi-length hem means it can be worn wherever without it looking like you've just run away from bridesmaid duties. | LoverOriginally $450 / Buy now for $270 from Amazon Australia.So it has the hallmarks of every conservative family-friendly garment — subdued colours, thick shoulder straps, midi-length, A-line skirt.

Of the form-fitting, midi-length dress with asymmetrical sleeve, she said:Promising review: ""When I first saw this dress, I was simultaneously excited and scared. I love an asymmetrical sleeve, but I don't often go for anything this figure-hugging for fear of it not flattering my body.Turns out, I had nothing to worry about. This dress was sexy, comfortable and showed off all my curves — while still looking elegant and classy. I really felt super glam and I loved it. I was initially worried that some of my rolls were showing through, but once I'd gotten over my own insecurities, I was really vibing this look.""-Natalia Krslovic | Harris Scarfe, TontineOriginally $209.99 / Buy now for $104.99 from Harris Scarfe.As you may have heard, Aussie retailer, Harris Scarfe, entered into voluntary administration last month and has begun the process of closing its doors.

This may seem like a childish adventure from Nintendo, but JEEZ within moments I'm sweating my butt off. To play, you'll place a JoyCon into both the ring con and a leg strap so your movements are monitored. To move through each level you have to physically run in place and each time you ""battle"" an enemy you have to do 15 reps of an exercise of your choosing. For example, each time I complete a squat the enemy receives a ""kick."" It's so fun I don't realize I'm working out until the game reminds me to take a break and have some water. It even monitors your heart rate for you. It's more intense than you'd expect!Get it from Amazon for $79.99. | amazon.comPromising review: ""Arrived today. Very easy to set up. I had it up on the wall in less than an hour. Looks great! I love that the medals can be hung below the bibs. I have 11 hung in total, which take up the entire rack.

It made me want to get up super early and run before the chaos of the day began. I started right after finishing her book and have continued ever since! If Khloe can do it, why can't we?Promising review: ""I bought this book not knowing much about it, except it was written by a Kardashian and I have a weakness sometimes of binge-watching their show. This book not only makes me see Khloe completely different, but this book is one of the most inspiring and motivating things I've read! After reading a chapter I found myself wanting to immediately work out, and become a kinder and driven person. I just happen to be a new mom working hard to lose the baby weight and stay positive, and this was the perfect book to keep me going when the going got tough and motivated me to not give up and push myself harder!

I did not even find the need to flip the belt as my phone and keys felt secure and I wanted easier access to my phone.

Boxing is one of them. Luckily, I can start practicing my skills (and break a decent sweat!) at home while playing this super-fun game on the Nintendo Switch. I use this game as a way to mix up my exercises / when I don't feel like venturing out to the gym. I have to say, it's a SERIOUS workout.

I am still fascinated with checking my info frequently and it works to motivate me on sluggish days. I wasn't sure I could get 10,000 steps a day in so I set it to 8,000 steps a day but I am managing to exceed the 10,000 on most days as I am averaging more than that. I have started running in addition to doing my 2x/ week weight workouts and still occasionally doing my at home DVD workouts. It also helps to make sure I am drinking enough water (although this requires that you log in how much you drink). I love the reminders! It buzzes me to let me know when I have hit my goal and to remind me to get my 250 steps in per hour. I also can log what i am eating and I was surprised to see I eat more calories than I thought. I am not currently trying to lose weight as I am breastfeeding my baby so I am not worried about that for the moment but I do want to keep working out to get back in shape. This is great for motivation, for tracking so I can see how I am doing and then when I go back in the log I can see how well I have done."" —DeliaGet it from Amazon for $143.99+ (available in two sizes and seven colors). | PelotonI am SO interested in trying out one of these bad boys. I'm a sucker for the commercials and have even gone as far as downloading the Peloton app in an attempt to recreate the classes on a stationary bike at my gym — but it's just not the same as being in your own home. If you already own one of these bikes, can I come over and give it a go? Kthanks.Promising review: ""Peloton, you have taken things to the next level... so happy I have a variety of classes, not only spinning. I’ve owned my bike for two years and my only complaint (at that time) was variety beyond the bike. I now have a new love for bootcamp, running, strength, stretching and yoga, and of course spinning. We dropped our family gym membership just a month ago and we have dedicated space in our house to have our tread, bike, and free weights. This was a game-changer!

So, you can be both *happy* you're drinking lots of water and *sad* you always have to pee. Such is life!Promising review: ""I'm in love with this bottle! Why? Because I only need to fill it ONCE and have my hydration requirements are met. The design is trendy, the motivational quotes help me stay on track AND it's pretty much portable.

I would order these 100 times over, actually contemplating getting another pair in a different color just because these are so perfect. I’ve had them for over two months and they have not worn out at all. Wipes clean and doesn’t stain which is amazing!!

Its many cute style options are for sure an added bonus!Promising review: ""Love love love love this!! I'm 5'10"" with LONG legs, so regular mats don't work for me. I step off them and they're not big enough. This one is amazing...nice and thick. Once I washed/prepped it, there's not slippage. You do have to wash/scrub it or it starts out pretty slick.

It's really simple to use — I like to do my crunches on it, as it gives me more back support. There are tons of other ways to break a sweat using this, so def consider adding it to your shopping cart.Promising review: ""Omg...I love this. I just did 5k race with my son and his friends, it's called The Inflatable5k, meaning you run 3 miles while having inflatable obstacles to run, jump, or climb upon.

Unexpected bonus!!"" —KatGet it from Amazon for $99.99+ (available in 11 styles). | Amazon, amazon.comThis is a prime example of something my gym has that I've always been too scared to try (for fear of quite literally falling on my face). The sliding technique used with this workout tool is great for building up your core — and actually looks kinda...fun? I'm gonna order a pair of these gliding discs to test out on my wood floors in the privacy of my own home. Who's with me?!Promising review: ""This seems like a simple idea, but I would never have thought of it. I like the ability to exercise arms, back, chest, and core in so many variations. You can cater movement based on how you position yourself and move the gliders; the nuance of movement is near limitless. I tried it on my hardwood floor, but prefer the easier gliding on carpet. I compare it to my ab roller and find it to be an interesting alternative. I can keep my hands with palms downward open flat or place my fists on it for slightly different stressing of the hand and forearm muscles."" —CharlieGet a set of two from Amazon for $10.97. | amazon.com, AmazonEssentially a tire with handles, this item is going to roll right into your workout routine.

It's also much smaller than other coated kettlebells I have, so great space-wise. The handle is a perfect size for two hand grabbing, not all of my kettlebells are.

My back has gotten so much stronger since I started using it as an office chair for one or two hours per day! I work from home and my back had gotten incredibly weak, to the point that I could only walk 1/4 mile before the pain would get EXTREMELY bad and unbearable. After two weeks of using the ball, I can now walk 1 mile before pain begins — that is a HUGE improvement and has made an even bigger impact on my happiness and quality of life.

Plus, it has 4.9K five-star reviews on Amazon, so you know it's legit.Promising review: ""Very good-quality materials are used, starting from the steel rope, which is encased in some sort of heavy-duty, slightly clear plastic to the smooth bearings. The finish of the rope is very slick and seems like it'll hold up a long time. If you grab the handle and spin it, the bearing will go 10 revolutions easily, speaking to the quality of the bearings. I've only had it a couple of weeks and it is holding up great. For $10, probably one of the best ropes you can get. And from what I read about the owners of the company and their warranty, seems like these folks will be more than happy to get a new rope over to you ASAP if your current one breaks for whatever reason."" —RomanGet it from Amazon for $10. | amazon.com, AmazonPromising review: ""With a new baby I found myself doing a lot of upper body exercises while holding my little one. While this is a great upper-body and potentially full-body workout, I found the baby to be a little too squirmy to be effective so I decided to pick up this medicine ball. It was a great choice. It's grippy, compact, and effective. It also doesn't have a tendency to spit up on me while doing chest presses, which is a big plus. Best part — this ball doesn't complain if I accidentally drop it. Honestly — this is a great basic medicine ball. The rubber skin provides great grip. No 'heavy spots,' with the weight evenly distributed across the ball. There are plenty of quick exercises you can do at home to do a full-body workout with the benefit of building both slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle. Ball seems plenty durable and should last a good long time. Great purchase.

You get everything you see in the product pictures and it is exactly as advertised. There is an instructional pamphlet that details several different exercises possible with these bands with images of the different setups. The foam bars are sturdy and I had no trouble getting a good workout from using the bands with the bars. There isn't really anything I can fault this product on. It is truly a terrific exercise product that will get you results if you put in the effort of using it. A plus is that it is so mobile and compact in the storage bag that I leave it by the television set so that I can get in a little exercise while I am watching"" —W.

Mis redes sociales repentinamente estaban llenas de historias y publicaciones de viejos amigos y miembros de la comunidad que se preparaban para arriesgar sus vidas por defender sus hogares. Al momento de escribir esto, algunos todavía lo siguen haciendo. | Siobhan Threlfall / BuzzFeed“Me desperté la mañana del 31 de diciembre alrededor de las 2:30 porque mi madre gritaba mi nombre. El cielo detrás de la casa de mis padres era solo un gran resplandor de color rojo, junto con el rugido del fuego haciendo eco en el valle. Mi mamá y nuestros dos perros evacuaron la ciudad. Mi papá, el jefe de bomberos voluntario de Nerrugundah; mi hermano, Caden; mi hermana, Skye, y yo nos quedamos para proteger la ciudad. Miembros ya estaban llegando al hangar de bomberos para cuando Caden y papá llegaron ahí. Inmediatamente, entraron al camión para (ir a) investigar el incendio, mientras Skye y yo llamábamos a todos en el valle.Papá predijo que el fuego no nos impactaría realmente durante otras dos horas. Mientras esperábamos, pusimos sistemas de aspersores, preparamos nuestras bombas de agua y retiramos los tanques de gas de la casa... todo mientras la radio emitía llamados de auxilio. Hubo llamadas de personas que se encontraban en peligro, llamadas de la tripulación que necesitaba ayuda urgente, así como llamadas que solicitaban ambulancias que ahora se necesitaban por todas partes en la Costa Sur. Mi hermano nos contactó por radio. Él y otra bombera voluntaria, Ashley, habían ido a ver cómo estaban los miembros de la comunidad, pero, por la cantidad de árboles caídos y el fuego que se dirigía directamente hacia ellos, no pudieron llegar con dos de nuestros miembros de la brigada. Se iban a quedar atrapados en su casa en el paso del fuego. No sabía si iba a volver a verlos"". | | | Ver esta nota en Facebook | AtenciónEsta imagen es gráficaToca para mostrarToca para mostrar",,"January 09, 2020, 16:57 GMT",

I was sick of having to scrape face mask gunk out from under my nails so these are a great alternative — plus I can use each for a different product if i'm using two at a time, and not risk cross-contamination. They are a little wide though, so they might not fit in all jars and some you might have to scoop the product out first onto another surface for that reason, or if like me, you use a volcanic clay mask, the product bends the silicone a bit if you try to scoop it from the jar since the clay is thick and the silicone is flimsy.

Having said that, the OPI matte top coat lasts just as long and re-applies much better than most other matte tops I've tried. Works great on top of gel manicures! If you're hooked on LED gels like me, this polish works great to matte down the ultra-wet appearance of LED-cured gel polishes. If you want the look of completely nude nails for any reason, (fashion, dress code, acting, etc.), but you don't want to sacrifice that protective shield of your super-strong gel manicures, try applying OPI Matte Top Coat over your clear OPI LED-cured manicure.

Some don't fit all bottles, some leak while pouring, and some are so tall that storing upright in a refrigerator is difficult and none seal completely. This spout/stopper seals completely and lets you lay the bottle on its side. The aerator allows air to move back into the bottle while pouring to avoid the 'glug glug' effect of other pour spouts. The strainer may filter large cork pieces, but is not fine enough for sediment. The portion of the corker that fits inside the bottle has fit every bottle I've tried it in, from standard size bottles to the larger 1.5 liter bottles. It appears to be made from a flexible material that doesn't add any unwanted taste to the wine.
